## Project Modules

### generics

The `generics` module demonstrates the use of generics in Java, highlighting how to create flexible, reusable, and type-safe code. It includes examples of:

- **Defining Generic Classes and Methods**: Shows how to create classes and methods that can operate on any object type while ensuring type safety.
- **Using Wildcards**: Explains the use of bounded and unbounded wildcards to create more flexible methods and classes. They can only be used in Lists.
- **Type Inference**: Illustrates how Java infers types in generic methods to simplify code.
- **Collections with Generics**: Provides examples of how to use Java's generic collections, like `List`, `Map`, and `Set`.

The module includes a comprehensive example demonstrating the conversion of arrays to lists, retrieving elements safely, and printing elements that implement specific interfaces. This helps to solidify the understanding of how generics can be utilized to create robust and maintainable code.
